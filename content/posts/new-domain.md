Hello everybody,
I've just moved my blog to a domain. The new domain is called
[https://shibumi.dev/](https://shibumi.dev/).  Why a new domain? Well, I think
this domain suits me better. It reflects my nickname on platforms like
[https://github.com/](https://github.com/), IRC, and various others. Also, all
dev domains have `HSTS` enabled on default for even more security and I've
switched my domain registrar from Hetzner to
[https://inwx.de](https://inwx.de) (Finally, `DNSSEC` yeah). Because some
websites still link to nullday.de, I have created a redirect to this website.
Although I am not sure how long I will keep this redirect (at least for a
year).
