## Intro

I spent the last three to four months working on the open source project [in-toto](https://in-toto.io) as part
of my Google Summer of Code stipend at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
Followers of my blog might have read already about in-toto. If you do not know the project, I
suggest you have a look on my [introduction to in-toto](/posts/introduction-to-in-toto/).
The introduction article has been written as part of my Google Summer of Code stipend and gives
a good overview about the project and what its objectives are.

## My challenge

The main objective of my Google Summer of Code stipend has been to port in-toto run functionality
from the in-toto Python reference implementation to the Go implementation. The in-toto run functionality
is responsible for generating in-toto link data. In-toto links are files, that represent a step
in a software supply chain. Each of these steps can be signed and later verified.
Adding in-toto run functionality to the Go implementation has been tracked in the following Github issues:

*  [https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/54](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/54)
*  [https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/30](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/30)
*  [https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/27](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/27)

The following key results must have been achieved:

* Signing generated link data via signature algorithms as specified in the [in-toto specification](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/master/in-toto-spec.md)
* Full support for RSA-PSS, ED25519 and ECDSA.
* Generating link files

My merged pull request, that addresses these key results can be found here: [https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/pull/56](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/pull/56)

During my journey I did a lot more than that. Implementing the above requirements lead us (my mentors and me) to a few other issues.
These issues were so significant that we decided to solve these issues, while working on the actual in-toto run implementation.
The following listing shall give a brief insight on what I have worked on additionally.

* Cleanup code indentation and multi-line comments:
	* Issue [#18](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/18)
	* PR [#51](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/pull/51)
* Handling unhandled errors:
	* PR [#52](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/pull/52)
* Reviving the in-toto symlink functionality PR and finishing it (this was a dependency for our in-toto run functionality):
	* Issue [#32](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/32)
	* PR [#55](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/pull/55)
* Handling excess data returned by `pem.Decode`:
	* Issue [#14](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/14)
	* PR (fixied within the main objective PR [#56](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/pull/56))
* Keeping OS interoperability via using the decoded PEM block, instead of raw PEM bytes:
	* Issue [#75](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/75)
	* PR [#76](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/pull/76)
* Moving our subSetCheck function to the utils.Set interface
	* Issue [#66](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/66)
	* PR [#73](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/pull/73)
* Support for Go 1.15 (moving to ecdsa.SignASN1 + fixing testMain)
	* Issue [#60](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/60) and [#64](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/64)
	* PR [#70](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/pull/70)
* Add Logo + fix Readme (because who does not like fancy logos?!)
	* PR [#77](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/pull/77)


The in-toto Go implementation is in direct relationship to the [in-toto Python implementation](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto) and the [in-toto specification](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/master/in-toto-spec.md). Therefore it is not surprising, that I have also addressed a few inconsistencies
in the specification and the Python implementation.

* Fixing over-importing in the in-toto Python implementation:
	* Issue [#378](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/issues/378)
	* PR [#379](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/pull/379)
* Fixing key word inconsistencies in the in-toto specification:
	* PR [#29](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/pull/29)
* Fixing a wrong data type for the return-value in the in-toto specification:
	* PR [#36](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/pull/36)

## Additional work

Additionally, the following issues have been uncovered during the development process:

* key format inconsistency in securesystemslib: Issue [#251](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/issues/251)
* compare the way we store symlinks in our link metadata to the reference implementation: Issue [#57](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/57)
* Hardware Security Module (HSM) support: Issue [#61](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/61)
* Moving to Github Actions for CI: Issue [#62](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/62)
* Test interoperability with the Python implementation via subprocess calls: Issue [#63](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/63)

* ecdsa-sha2-nistp384 support: Issue [#67](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/67)
* validate functions, specifically key validations: Issue [#68](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/68)

* Use Go Linter for CI: Issue [#74](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/issues/74)

A few of these issues have first drafts already. I have worked on this drafts during my Google Summer of Code stipend, too:

* [Add Github Actions Support](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/pull/72)
* [Gitignore like exclude patterns](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang/pull/53)

## My personal highlights

During the Google Summer of Code my personal highlights were [finding and submitting a patch for a tiny bug in Go's crypto/rsa library](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/240008) and attending the Kubecon 2020.

## What did I learn?

I had a lot of fun while working on the CNCF project in-toto, but did I also
learn something? The answer is clearly **yes**.  Before the Google Summer of
Code I have contributed already to open source projects, but these
contributions were mostly small bug fixes, reporting bugs or my very system and
security focused work at Arch Linux.  It has been a long dream to contribute
more than just a few lines of code to a project, but in the past I had
difficulties to get into such a project. The Google Summer of Code was my first
successful try to deep-dive into a foreign code base and to contribute more
than just a few lines of code. This experience definitely increased my skills
in reading foreign code, getting faster familiar with a foreign code-base and
communicating with project developers. Furthermore, in-toto challenged my
security skills and lead to a much wider understanding of signing algorithms
such like ED25519, RSA-PSS or ECDSA and key formats such like PKCS1, PKCS8 or
PEM. This project increased my security awareness in terms of cryptography
significantly.

## Plans for the future

Well, I think I totally fall in love with the project. Not only I did never
join such a welcoming and interesting community, I have also finally found a
project, that I think is important, interesting and challenging at the same
time. Moreover I really think, that my future career goals will come one step
closer with this project. The Go implementation and the near to the CNCF will
definitely help me in increasing my Site Reliability Skills.

## Special thanks

I do not want to finish, before honouring a few people I have worked with.
First I want to thank my three mentors Lukas PÃ¼hringer, Justin Cappos and
Santiago Torres-Arias. They always reacted quickly when needed and they always
gave me the right hints, when I had difficulties understanding the specification
or the code base. Especially the work with Lukas was very enjoyable and I look forward
to a lot more interesting discussions in future pull requests and issues.
Santiago has been always there for me, when I needed a fast contact, when I did a few hours
too much. The timezone difference was definitely a bonus and not a malus this time.
Besides my mentors I want to highlight the excellent help from Trishank Karthik Kuppusamy.
Trishank has not been my mentor, but still he supported me in many ways and we had a few
interesting discussions around the in-toto specification. I am pretty sure, this will be not
the last discussions we had about the in-toto specification.
